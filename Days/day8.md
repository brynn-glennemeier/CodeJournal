# What I learned (4/5/22)

## Filter + Reduce

Today we learned about filter and reduce. I think it was pretty simple and easy
to learn. basically what filter is, you filter it to only get one thing. For
instance we used girl and boy baby names. So we filtered the boy names and girl names
to get them by themselves.

Reduce is when you kind of figure out how many of one thing there is. For
instance, we figured out how many boy names there are and how many girl
names there are.
