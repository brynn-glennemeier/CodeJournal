## Difference between PickerView View Controller + CollectionView View Controller

Personally i feel like there is quite a difference between the two of them.

### PickerView View Controller:

PickerView is where you can pick things from this scroll picker thing. Personally
to me it is a little bit more difficult and i think the reasoning behind that
is, that there are more stuff you have to keep track of.

### CollectionView View Controller:
CollectionView is where you have a collection of things all in one place. You
can choose how many of the collection you'd like. It's pretty simple for the
most parts.

### Differences between the two:

* They have different formats.
* They for the most part have different codes that go with them.
* In a CollectionView ViewController, have cells that go with them
