# What I learned (2/24/2022)

## AWS

IAM is gives you access to all of AWS. It basically lets you specify who can
gain access to what service. EC2 was honestly the most difficult one for me.
It was hard to follow along because there was just so much stuff that we had
to do as well as just so much stuff on the page. MFA is the Google Authenticator.
It was pretty easy to set up.
